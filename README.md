# DS Filter Customizer 1.0
# https://www.nexusmods.com/darksouls/mods/1411
This utility allows you to customize the built-in visual filters of Dark Souls 1. Supports multiple profiles, global or localized filter replacement, and realtime editing.
Requires [.NET 4.7.1](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/thank-you/net471), which you probably already have.

# Installation
Extract the mod folder anywhere you like, then run DS Filter Customizer.exe.  
Once Dark Souls is running, your filters will automatically be applied.

# Profiles
Click the Clone button to make a copy of an existing profile, or New to create a profile with default values.  
There are four profile types:  
* Global - one filter will be applied no matter where you are.
* Multiplier - the vanilla filters for each area will be multiplied by one filter you define.
* Detailed - define one or two filters for each different area.
* Full Control - every filter used by the game is available for editing.
Changes will take effect immediately in-game, but remember to click Save to make them permanent before closing the app.

# Sharing Profiles
Your profiles can be found in the "profiles" folder alongside the .exe. Each one is saved in a separate .xml file, so all you need to do is upload it somewhere, and drop any downloaded profiles in the same folder.
